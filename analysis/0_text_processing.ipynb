      "If you're in the mood for a decent political thriller, look no further than \"The Sentinel.\" Michael Douglas stars as Pete Garrison, a secret service agent who finds himself framed for a plot to assassinate the President. With the help of the First Lady (played by Kim Basinger) and a fellow agent (Kiefer Sutherland), Garrison goes on the run and conducts his own investigation to clear his name and uncover the real traitor. Though it's not the most original film out there and can feel a bit cliché at times, the performances by Douglas, Basinger, and Sutherland keep the suspense going throughout. It's not a must-see, but a reasonably entertaining way to spend an evening.\n",
